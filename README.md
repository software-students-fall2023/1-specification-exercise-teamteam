## Stakeholders

`Stakeholder A: (neurodivergent individual w/ ADD)`
- The Emergency contact feature is essential and therefore should be easily accessible.
- The feature for counteracting stimulus overload might not be as useful as many will often forget to use it when the situation -arises.
- Consider it for pre-planned alarms for when user is going to crowded places.
- Notifications should be attention-grabbing as many people may simply ignore their reminders when they become redundant.
- The idea of having an in-game pet is nice, especially if it gives the aforementioned reminders.
- The app shouldn’t ask lots of questions on what features the users want since it might then become a barrier to set up and use the app.
- Include features that keep users' hands busy.
- Standardized reminders for daily tasks such as eating and showering can be included. 
- Try not to include wording that infantilize users.

`Stakeholder B: (Psych student w/ background in working with neurodivergent children)`
- The idea of a focus timer and visual reminders is good but emphasized they should be optional.
- Believed the app's emergency alert is vital, especially for children.
- Emphasized the importance of the app's user interface and design, ensuring not to overwhelm users.
- Suggested the app should offer users checkboxes to identify their specific challenges, with the app then customizing features based on these inputs or to have presets.
- The interviewee sees the app positively impacting neurodivergent individuals by aiding them in social situations and helping handle sensory overloads.
